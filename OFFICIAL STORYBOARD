TEXT BASED 2 PLAYER HANGMAN
ROUGH DRAFT TWO

BEGINNING:
- explain game
- ask player one to enter the category of their phrase
  example: if they choose Transformers, the category would be movie (could be something else, but what the word/phrase is more associated with)
- enter the word/phrase
- confirm with player one
- ask player one to hand over the device to player two & press any key (or enter) to start the game


RULES
- Try to guess the secret word/phrase by only using letters from the alphabet before all the parts of hangman are there!
- Each error will count as one body part of hangman!
- You are able to fully type out the phrase/word, however if it's wrong that would be 2 body parts instead of one.. so be careful!
- In total, you are able to have 7 errors. The head,  torso, right arm, left arm, left leg, right leg, and the rope! If all of those appear, you lose!
